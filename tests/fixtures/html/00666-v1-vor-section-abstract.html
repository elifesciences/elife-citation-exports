                <p>This is the abstract. This article will describe the eLife article and the process.
                    An abstract can contain any formatting, such as <em>italics</em>,
                        <strong>bold</strong>, <sup>superscript</sup>, <sub>subscript</sub> or <sc>small caps</sc>. MathML is
                    also allowed: 
                    <span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><munder><mo></mo><mi>m</mi></munder><mrow><msub><mover accent="true"><mi>p</mi><mo></mo></mover><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow></math></span>
                        </span>
                .</p>
                <p>eLife does not structure abstracts into sub headings expect in a clinical trial article, but the abstract can have
                    multiple paragarahs. The sub DOI is always .001 as it is the first asset in any
                    article. I have added an unmatched &gt; bracket as this has been an issue for PubMed deposits in the past.</p>
                <p>If this was a clinical trial the clinical trial details would be listed at the end of the abstract:</p>
                <p>Clinical trial Registration: EudraCT2004-000446-20.</p>
