<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Early career researchers reside in a high-pressure environment. In addition to publishing high-quality papers, applicants for widely-coveted fellowship and lectureship positions have to show clear indications of independent research, collaborations and leadership skills. Demonstrating this is not an easy task, particularly since most early career researchers are paid to work on supervised research projects, which hinders them from becoming truly independent and assuming leadership roles.</p><p>For the purpose of aiding this transition between postdoc and fully independent researcher, we introduce the concept of a science hackathon. These events offer early career researchers the opportunity to be exposed to new scientific research questions, to explore how their own ideas might fit into the larger research landscape, and to develop their own research agenda. We discuss the merits and challenges, based on our own experiences of organizing a series of science hackathons. Following on from the success of the first event in September 2014 (which we summarize in <a class="xref-boxed-text" href="#box1">Box 1</a>), we are currently organizing two additional science hackathons, which will take place in the second half of 2015.</p><div class="boxed-text"><span class="boxed-text-label">Box 1.</span><h3>The First ‘2020 Science’ Hackathon.</h3><p>We held the first science hackathon in Flore, Northamptonshire, with funding support from the Software Sustainability Institute and the ‘2020 Science’ programme, both funded in the UK by EPSRC. We ran five projects with 22 participants in total, which led to six paper drafts and two software packages. For example, we ran a protocol paper project on Bayesian inference of animal receptor models and another project on a comparison of code development approaches and techniques in academia. Overall, the event was a great success with highly positive feedback from the participants. Both funding sources were keen to support similar events in the future. At this time, we have funding for two more science hackathons, and are planning to organize these in the fall of 2015.
