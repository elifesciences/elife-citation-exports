HSV-2 levels in the genital tract are stable over minutes, expand and decay markedly over hours, and fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably over days. (A) Shedding quantity in a participant, who performed genital swabs every 5 min over 4 hr during a lesion, reveals low swab-to-swab variation in viral quantity. Using data from panel (A and B), absolute mean difference (R2 = 0.99), and (C) mean difference (R2 = 0.87), in HSV DNA copies between swabs, are a function of time between swabs. (D) Shedding quantity in a participant, who performed 10 genital swabs per day during a lesion over 4 days (swabs every 2â€“4 hr), shows a characteristic saw-tooth pattern; arrows denote rapid viral re-expansion; the participant had a negative swab performed before episode onset. (E) Shedding quantity in a participant, who performed four genital swabs per day over 17 days demonstrates that rapid and frequent viral re-expansion allows for shedding prolongation; four missing data points are left blank.
